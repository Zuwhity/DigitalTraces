# DigitalTraces

During our class session at EPF we had to create a small web site via Deta App that host it for free and where we can do some analytics on it.
We also need to had the dependencies of flask project

The URL of the web site is the following : https://itsyzi.deta.dev

You will also find the code I used to print the Hello World message and get the number of visitors getting on my website.
